# LANGCHAIN-INTEGRATION

## Description

This Quarkus application demonstrates integration with AI models, leveraging the LangChain4j library and OpenAI services.
It serves as a backend language translation and prompt injection detection service using WebSockets, showcasing how AI capabilities can be embedded into modern reactive Java applications using Quarkus.
The project enables natural language translation with AI-assisted validation and security features like prompt injection detection.
