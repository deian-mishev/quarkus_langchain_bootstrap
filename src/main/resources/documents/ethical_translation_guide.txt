Ethical Translation Guide for AI-Powered Services

Purpose:
This guide outlines best practices and safeguards for ensuring that AI-powered translation systems uphold ethical standards, protect human dignity, and avoid translating harmful or offensive content.

Core Principles:
1. Respect for Human Dignity
   AI translators must not reproduce or propagate language that degrades individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, or any other protected status.

2. No Amplification of Harm
   Offensive content, including slurs, hate speech, threats, or discriminatory language, must be detected and not translated—neither literally nor euphemistically.

3. Transparency and Responsibility
   Users should be clearly informed when content has been blocked or redacted due to ethical guidelines.

What Not to Translate:
The system must block, flag, or redact content that includes:
- Racial or ethnic slurs
- Sexist or misogynistic language
- Homophobic or transphobic expressions
- Religious insults or blasphemy (based on local/regional legal contexts)
- Hate symbols, coded language, or dog whistles
- Explicit threats, harassment, or calls to violence

Attempting to “sanitize” offensive content through translation may unintentionally normalize it. Instead, clearly indicate content was not translated due to ethical restrictions.

Safe Handling Workflow:
1. Detection
   Implement an offensive language filter (using keyword lists, pattern matching, or pretrained classifiers) before translation.

2. Flagging & Redaction
   If content is flagged:
   - Stop translation.
   - Return a message like:
     "Validation failed: Translation blocked due to harmful or offensive language."

3. Logging for Review (Optional but recommended)
   Log instances (with anonymization) for manual review and system improvement, especially if false positives or negatives occur.

4. User Feedback Mechanism (optional)
   Provide users with a way to report blocked content as a false positive or submit offensive content that was missed.
